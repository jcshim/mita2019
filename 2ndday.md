Title: Decision Making by Photons 



Summary: Decision making in dynamically changing uncertain environments is one of the most important elements in information and communications technologies. Here we present our recent research on accelerating decision making by classical and quantum light. By utilizing the wave-particle duality of single photons, the exploratory action in decision making is physically experimentally realized, leading to autonomous decision making. The principle is transformed to ultrafast laser chaos where the chaotically oscillated irregular time series provides fast and scalable decision-making abilities. We also present entangled-photon decision maker for achieving social benefit maximization and ensuring fairness and equality among individuals. Theories and applications of photonic decision makers are reviewed.
